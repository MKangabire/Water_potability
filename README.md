## **Group Members**  
- **Denys Ntwaritaganzwa**  
- **John Akech**  
- **Merveil Kangabire**  

## **Project Overview**  
This project builds a **neural network-based classification model** to predict **water potability** using a provided dataset. Each team member applies **different optimization techniques**, allowing for a meaningful performance comparison.  

---

## **Dataset**  
We use the **[Water Quality and Potability Dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VXHjV4Hi7d__I9v2KYudh32OVud3aEvm/view)** from **Kaggle**.

## **Installation**  
To set up the project environment, run:  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
---

## **Data Preprocessing**  
âœ” Load dataset and handle missing values  
âœ” Normalize features for better training performance  
âœ” Split data into **70% training, 15% validation, and 15% testing**  

---

## **Model Training**  
Each member designed a **unique model** with different **optimization techniques**:  

- **Denys Ntwaritaganzwa** â†’ **Adam optimizer** with **L1_L2 regularization**  
- **John Akech** â†’ **RMSprop optimizer** with **L2 regularization**  
- **Merveil Kangabire** â†’ **SGD optimizer** with **L1**  

Each model was **trained and evaluated separately**.  

---

## **Model Evaluation**  
Each model was compared based on:  
âœ” **Accuracy**  
âœ” **F1 Score**  
âœ” **Precision & Recall**  
âœ” **Loss Analysis**  

**Performance Summary Table:**
